*** Ruby
For these exercises, you may want to check out the API documentation for the Ruby Array class here:

http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html

1. Create a Person class with two attributes: name and age.

2. Create an Employee class that inherits from Person and that has the additional attribute company. The
   Employee class should have a constructor that takes name, age and company, but company should be an 
   optional argument.

3. Create an employees Array object and add two Employee objects to it: Peter 35 years old working for Newsdesk,
   Joe 35 years old working for Google, and Helena 27 years old working for Volvo.

4. From your employee array, create a variable ages that is a Hash object with the ages of the people as keys
   and a sorted array of names as values, i.e. the ages variable should contain:
   
   {27 => ["Helena"], 35 => ["Joe", "Peter"]}

   Hint: you may use the Array#inject method like this:
   
   ages = employees.inject({}) do |hash, employee|
     # initialize/append to hash[employee.age] here...
     hash # you need to return the hash here in order for inject to work
   end
   
   You can also use a while loop to solve this task, but you get extra points if you use inject :-)

5. Using the Array#select, Array#map and Array#join methods to create a comma separated string containing
   company names for people over 30 years old.

6. Create a Ruby module "CanTalk" with a say_hi method. Make the say_hi method output (to standard output)
   for example "Peter says hi", where "Peter" should be dynamic and come from the name instance variable.
   Open up the Person class and include the CanTalk module. Invoked the say_hi method for the first
   employee in the employees array.

7. Give a Ruby example for each of the following and/or say something about the naming
   conventions for each (uppercase, lowercase, mixed case, etc.):
  a) Symbol objects
  b) Instance variables
  c) Class variables
  d) Constants
  e) Class names
  f) Method names

*** Rails

8. Create a new Rails application called test. Create a database and make sure you can connect to it.

10. Create a User model with a scaffold administration interface. Make the model have the following attributes:

  name          (string)
  password      (string)
  department_id (integer)
  admin         (boolean)

   Create the users table in the database.
   
11. Create a Department model with a scaffold administration interface. Make the Department model have the following attributes:

  name          (string)

    Create the departments table in the database.
    
12. Create a one-to-many relationship between departments and users so that one department has one or more users.

13. Make sure that the User model cannot be saved without a name and a password.
    Also make sure that the name is less than 100 characters.

14. In the Rails console, create a department and a user for that department. Save your objects to the database.

15. Change the sorting of users on the users/index page to be by name. You should do the sorting in the database
    (via ActiveRecord) and not in Ruby. Change it so that administrator users are not listed on that page.

16. Change ther users/index page so that it shows department names rather than department id:s.

17. Make the users/index action available at the URL '/user-listing'

18. Change the form for creating new users so that you can select department in a dropdown (select box).

19. Add a login action to the users controller so that you can log in with a request like the following:

    http://localhost:3000/users/login/name=peter&password=foobar

20. Add a method current_user to the application controller that returns the currently logged in user. If no user
    is logged in the method should return nil. 

21. Change the departments controller so that to use the departments administration interface
    (any of the actions in the departments controller) you must be logged in as a user that
    has the admin column set to true. If you are not logged in as an admin user you should be redirected
    to the homepage with a flash[:notice] message.

22. Add a logout page at /logout where you can log yourself out.

23. Show the log in status in the upper right corner of all pages. If you are logged then your name should
    be displayed and there should be a logout link. If you are not logged in there should be a login link.

24. If possible, make the users/index page only issue one database query.

25. Put the form fields (text_field etc.) and labels for creating/editing users in a partial so that you
    can reuse them in the users/new and users/edit forms.
